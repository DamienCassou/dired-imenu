# dired-imenu: Bind dired and imenu

In Emacs, `dired` is a mode for "editing" directory listings while
`imenu` helps you jump to a particular place in a buffer.

`dired-imenu` integrates `imenu` in `dired` so you can easily jump to
any file and directory in the current buffer (to rename it, change its
permissions...)
